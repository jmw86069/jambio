be log2-transformed with \code{log2(x+1)}.}

Argument \code{zeroAsNA=TRUE} is recommended when using kmer
quantitation tools such as Salmon or Kallisto, which can
sometimes allocate all expression to one or another transcript
isoform when two isoforms are nearly identical. Also use
\code{TRUE} when a value of zero represents the absense of data.}

both \code{iMatrixTx} and \code{iMatrixTxTPM} are supplied, as follows:

\code{iMatrixTx} data; \code{"both"} requires both \code{iMatrixTx} and
\code{iMatrixTxTPM} data meet the threshold; \code{"either"} requires
that one or both of \code{iMatrixTx} and \code{iMatrixTxTPM} meet the
threshold.}

values instead of group mean values.}

\details{
This function aims to combine evidence from RNA-seq sequence
read counts (or pseudocounts from a kmer tool such as Salmon or
Kallisto), along with alternative TPM quantitation, to determine
the observed "detected" transcript space for a given experiment.

Each input data matrix is assumed to be appropriately log-transformed,
typically using \code{log2(1+x)}. If any value is \verb{>= 50} then the data
matrix will be log2-transformed using \code{log2(1+x)}.

The criteria must be met in at least one sample group, but all
criteria must be met in the same sample group for an isoform to
be considered "detected".

In our experience the use of TPM values appears more robust and
is conceptually the best approach for comparing the relative
quantity of one transcript isoform to another. Our reasoning is
that TPM is intended to be roughly a molar quantity of transcript
molecules, independent of the transcript length, and the potential
for overlapping regions between isoforms. We also recommend the use
of a kmer quantitation method, such as Salmon or Kallisto, which
estimates isoform abundances not by specific read counts, but by
quantifying kmers unique to particular isoforms for a given gene.

In all cases, the thresholds for detection can be modified, however
from our experiences thus far the default values perform reasonably
well at identifying expressed isoforms, while filtering out isoforms
that we considered to be spuriously expressed.

There are three default requirements for a transcript to be considered
"detected".
\enumerate{
\item An isoform must be expressed at least 10\% of the max isoform for
a given gene, using TPM values.
\item An isoform must have at least log2(32) pseudocounts to be considered
detected, based upon our view of Salmon pseudocount data using MA-plots.
\item An isoform must have at least log2(2) TPM units to be considered
detected, based upon our view of Salmon TPM values using MA-plots.
}

Each experiment is likely to be different in terms of total
sequenced reads, quality of read alignment or quantitation to the
transcriptome, etc. We suggest observing MA-plots for the counts and
TPM values, for the point at which the signal substantially increases
from baseline zero. We also plotted the TPM versus count per sample,
noted the point at which the two signals began to correlate. These
observations along with careful review of numerous gene model
transcript isoforms supported our selection of these criteria.

Lastly, the requirement for 10 percent of max isoform expression
was motivated by observing highly expressed genes, which sometimes had
alternative isoforms with extremely low abundance compared to the
most abundant isoform, but which was notably higher than the minimum
for detection. For example Gapdh expression above 100,000 pseudocounts,
may have an isoform with 120 pseudocounts. When we reviewed the sequence
coverage, we could find no compelling evidence to support the minor
isoform, and theorized that the pseudocounts arose from the stochastic
nature of rebalancing relative expression among isoforms.

Note the argument \code{zeroAsNA=TRUE}, which by default treats any
expression value of zero (or less than zero) as \code{NA},
thus removing them from group
mean calculations. When \code{iMatrixTxGrp} and \code{iMatrixTxTPMGrp}
are not supplied, this option is helpful in calculating a more
appropriate group mean expression value, notably when a
value of zero represents absence of data. Any group mean that is
\code{NA} as a result is converted to zero for the purpose of applying
filters.
